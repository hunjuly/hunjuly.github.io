title: Essence-Based Interpretation
---

## 1. Introduction

I have spent a long time and put in a lot of effort to write good code. To write good code, I studied refactoring, design patterns, various architectures, and development methodologies. Even when my code worked well, I constantly thought about better structures and names.

Nevertheless, I couldn't make clear decisions in the moment of choice and kept implementing method A one day and method B the next. This is because both methods had clear advantages and disadvantages, so I would feel unsatisfied no matter which method I chose. Here, the method could be a design pattern, or it could be the name of a function or variable.

At that time, I thought I had a certain level of competence as a developer, but it seemed like this agony of choice would never disappear no matter how much experience and effort I accumulated. I even thought that this might be an area of art where there is no correct answer and only personal preferences, like developers who don't understand design patterns dismissing them as useless in practice. It seemed like an insurmountable wall to me. It might have been a defense mechanism, similar to how developers who don't understand design patterns dismiss them as useless in practice.

Then I suddenly realized what I had been missing: `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)`. `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` is an effort to gain insight into the essence of something when looking at it.

Since this concept came to me while contemplating `DDD(Domain-Driven Design)`, it has a similar context to `DDD(Domain-Driven Design)`. So I feel a bit embarrassed to define it with the grandiose name of `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)`. However, I want to define `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` with the hope that it will help many developers, including myself, to more clearly recognize the existence of this concept.

Since `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` is not a concrete methodology but closer to an abstract concept, it is difficult to explain in clear sentences. So I want to explain what `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` is through a few examples.

## 2. Implementation of Arrow Keys

The user needs to be provided with arrow keys to select 'up/down/left/right'. The shapes of the 4 arrows are the same, only the directions are different. There are two ways to implement the arrow keys.

### 2.1. Method #1 - Reusing one image by rotating it

`Method #1` is to implement it by rotating one arrow image (arrow.png). Since the shapes of the arrows are the same, it can be easily implemented.

This method has the advantage of taking up less storage space. However, it has the disadvantage of relatively lower code readability.

```html
<View src="arrow.png" rotate="0" />
<View src="arrow.png" rotate="180" />
<View src="arrow.png" rotate="-90" />
<View src="arrow.png" rotate="90" />
```

*[Figure 2-1] Arrow keys implemented by rotating one image*

### 2.2. Method #2 - Using 4 images

`Method #2` is to use 4 images corresponding to up/down/left/right.

This method has the disadvantage of the inconvenience of managing more image resources and taking up more storage space. On the other hand, the code readability is relatively good.

```html
<View src="up.png" />
<View src="down.png" />
<View src="left.png" />
<View src="right.png" />
```

![Arrow Keys 2](/assets/images/arrows2.svg) \
*[Figure 2-2] Arrow keys implemented with 4 up/down/left/right images*

### 2.3. What is the right method?

What is the right thing to do? Or does right and wrong even exist in this choice? Is it just a matter of personal philosophy? If you pursue readable code, it would be `Method #1`, but if you pursue efficiency, it would be `Method #2`.

Is readable code right? Is performance-efficient code right? In the past, performance efficiency was generally prioritized, but these days when hardware performance is sufficient, readable code is preferred. Should we choose readable code for that reason?

Many developers probably focused on the fact that the shapes of the arrows are the same and chose `Method #1` to pursue efficiency by rotating the image.

There may be various thoughts, but the first thing to consider is the meaning of the arrows. If the arrows are used to point to a specific object as in *[Figure 2-3]*, then it is correct to implement it by rotating the arrows as in `Method #1`.

![Arrow Keys 3](/assets/images/arrows3.svg) \
*[Figure 2-3] Arrows used to point to something*

However, the arrow keys that the user thought of were probably the 4 fixed arrow keys in the corner of the keyboard, as in *[Figure 2-4]*. And what is similar to such user's thoughts is using 4 images as in `Method #2`.

![Arrow Keys 4](/assets/images/arrows4.svg) \
*[Figure 2-4] Arrow keys with different arrow shapes*

You might think that there isn't much difference no matter which method you choose because the end result shown to the user is the same. What happens if you pursue only implementation convenience while ignoring the user's thoughts?

The user thinks that the shapes of the arrows can be easily changed at any time. This is because the user naturally thinks that the arrow keys are composed of 4 images. Optimizing performance by rotating the image is solely from the developer's perspective. And one day, the user may lightly request to change the shapes of the arrow keys as in *[Figure 2-4]*. They will think it's an easy task since you only need to change the key images. However, for the developer, it becomes a big task of having to change the implementation method.

The fact that the shapes of the arrows are the same is just a coincidence. Reflecting this coincidental situation in the implementation distances it from the user's thoughts. In other words, if you pursue only implementation convenience while ignoring the user's intent, maintenance becomes increasingly difficult.

### 2.4. Difficulty of Interpretation

One of the reasons for agonizing over multiple methods is that obvious information is omitted.

When the user mentioned arrow keys as a requirement, they probably didn't specifically explain that it's those arrow keys on the keyboard. From the user's perspective, when they say arrow keys, they naturally think it's those on the keyboard.

However, from the developer's perspective, there is no additional information about the arrow keys, so they agonize a bit more when choosing the implementation method.

This is the difficult part of interpretation. The parts that are considered obvious and omitted from specific definitions must be filled in by the developer during the development stage. And for the developer to fill in the omitted parts, a lot of experience and insight are needed to consider all the reasons and processes behind why the requirements were defined that way.

What if you can't accurately grasp the user's intent in the current situation? Or what if you can't predict how it will change?

You can define `<Up /><Down /><Left /><Right />` classes so that no matter how the arrow requirements change, it won't affect other parts.

> This happened when I was working at a company that operates an online shopping mall. The topic of the meeting was how to implement 'coupons'.
>
> At that time, the development team was only handling payment amounts in the currency unit of 'won'. All the amounts stored in the DB were in 'won', and the amounts handled in the code were also in 'won'. The concept of 'payment amount' from the user's perspective was not considered.
>
> In this situation, the concept of 'points' was introduced. Fortunately, at that time, it was a simple structure where 1 point equals 1 won, so it could be handled relatively easily by adding a point column to the DB.
>
> However, as the service expanded and features such as discount coupons and tier benefits were added, the 'payment amount' perceived by the user became a complex concept that could not be simply expressed in won. The existing 'won'-centric implementation method could no longer fully reflect the user's payment flow.
>
> If we had thought more deeply about the meaning of 'payment amount' at the beginning of the project, we could have smoothly handled many changes later on.
>
> Of course, this is not an easy thing to do. Fundamentally, you need to be proficient in object-oriented programming, which itself is not easy. And since you don't know when and how the payment function will change, it would be difficult for even a skilled developer to create a 'payment amount' object from the beginning.

## 3. Shallow Routing vs Nested Routing in REST API

[Figure 3-1] is a sequence diagram of the user selecting the currently showing movie/theater/time in a movie ticketing service. How should the routing of the REST API be designed here?

{% plantuml %}
@startuml
actor User as customer
participant "Frontend" as front
participant "Backend" as back

customer -> front : Access movie ticketing system
front -> back : Request list of currently showing movies
front <-- back : movies[]
customer <-- front : Provide list of movies
customer -> front : Select movie
front -> back : Request list of theaters showing the movie
front <-- back : theaters[]
customer <-- front : Provide list of theaters
customer -> front : Select theater
front -> back : Request list of showtimes
front <-- back : showdates[]
customer <-- front : Provide list of showtimes
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}

*[Figure 3-1]*

### 3.1. Shallow Routing

If designed in the `Shallow Routing` format, it would be similar to the following:

```sh
# Request list of currently showing movies
/movies?status=showing

# Request list of theaters showing the movie
/theaters?movieId={movieId}

# Request list of showtimes
/showdates?movieId={movieId}&theaterId={theaterId}
```

`Shallow Routing` has the advantage of good scalability since each resource can be managed independently. However, it has the disadvantage of not clearly expressing the relationships between resources, making it difficult to represent data with a complex hierarchical structure.

### 3.2. Nested Routing

If designed in the `Nested Routing` format, it would be similar to the following:

```sh
# Request list of currently showing movies
/showing/movies

# Request list of theaters showing the movie
/showing/movies/{movieId}/theaters

# Request list of showtimes
/showing/movies/{movieId}/theaters/{theaterId}/showdates
```

`Nested Routing` is suitable for expressing complex resource structures since the relationships between resources can be clearly expressed in the URL. However, flexibility is limited because if the nested resource structure changes, the URL must also change accordingly.

### 3.3. What is the right method?

We briefly looked at the advantages and disadvantages of the two REST API routing design methods. So which method should we choose between the flexibility of `Shallow Routing` and the clarity of `Nested Routing`?

Which one to choose between the two methods should be based on what better expresses the movie ticketing process from a conceptual perspective.

In that sense, `Nested Routing` directly reflects the ticket purchase process.
Just as in the ticket purchase process you have to select a movie before selecting a theater, in `Nested Routing` you cannot specify a theater without specifying a movie first.
In other words, the REST API of `Nested Routing` expresses a structure similar to the ticket purchase process.
This should be enough to understand the ticket purchase process without separate documentation.

I often see debates about which is better between `Shallow Routing` and `Nested Routing`.
However, such debates are meaningless. What's important is which one more accurately reflects the requirements.
From a technical perspective, debating over a problem with no answer leads to never-ending debates.

"If you think hard but can't find an answer, the answer is not there."

### 3.4. Class Inheritance and Composition

Another debate similar to the debate between `Shallow Routing` and `Nested Routing` is class inheritance and composition.

Just as there is a general consensus that `Shallow Routing` is technically superior due to the advantages of flexibility, it is said that it is a good reuse method to avoid inheritance and use composition for classes if possible. However, this is also the same in that you should consider what better expresses the domain concept, not prioritize technical superiority.

{% plantuml %}
@startuml
package "Inheritance" {
    class Animal {
        - int age
        + void eat()
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        + void bark()
    }
}

package "Composition" {
    class Car {
        - Engine engine
        + void start()
    }

    class Engine {
        + void start()
    }

    Car *-- Engine
}
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}

In the diagram above, Dog is a type of Animal. It is natural to express this with inheritance. On the other hand, Engine is one of the components that make up Car. It is natural to express this with composition.

## 4. Implementation Method for Documents with Similar Formats

There are two types of authentication methods for the overseas use of documents issued in Korea, such as income certificates: 'apostille' and 'consular confirmation'.
Consular confirmation is the general procedure, and apostille is a more simplified version of the consular confirmation procedure according to an agreement.

The goal of the project was to build a system that could encrypt these two documents and check for tampering.

Since the apostille and consular confirmation documents had similar items and structures, the previously built service also shared a single table.

{% plantuml %}
@startuml
class documents {
    id : int
    ...

    type : consular | apostille
}
note right
Previously, it was being stored in
the documents table, differentiated by type
end note
@enduml
{% endplantuml %}

### 4.1. Initial Design

During the process of analyzing the existing system, it seemed to me that the similarity between consular confirmation and apostille was just a coincidence and they shouldn't be treated as the same document. If they were the same document, the project name wouldn't have been 'Apostille & Consular Confirmation'.

On the other hand, the back-end developer was arguing that there was no need to separate them.
In the end, as a compromise, we decided to separate only the REST API into two and implement the service and table as one.

{% plantuml %}
@startuml
left to right direction

package "Decided to separate only the REST API into two and implement the service and table as one" {
    package "REST API Layer" {
    [Apostille API]
    [Consular API]
    }

    package "Service Layer" {
    [Document Service]
    }

    package "Data Layer" {
    [Document Table]
    }

    [Apostille API] --> [Document Service]
    [Consular API] --> [Document Service]
    [Document Service] --> [Document Table]
}

@enduml
{% endplantuml %}

### 4.2. Design Change

However, as the project progressed, the differences between the two documents began to materialize.
The document numbers of apostille and consular confirmation could overlap, so the document number systems became different.
And as the service functions expanded, the interfaces of the two documents became increasingly different.

In the end, we decided to split the table into two and separate the internal structure as well.
Fortunately, since the APIs exposed externally were already separated into two, it was relatively easy to change the internal structure.
If we had tried to avoid refactoring because separating was burdensome, the code would have been flooded with if-else statements everywhere and the door to hell would have opened.

{% plantuml %}
@startuml
left to right direction

package "Completely separated service and table" {
    package "REST API Layer" {
    [Apostille API]
    [Consular API]
    }

    package "Service Layer" {
    [Apostille Service]
    [Consular Service]
    }

    package "Data Layer" {
    [Apostille Table]
    [Consular Table]
    }

    [Apostille API] --> [Apostille Service]
    [Consular API] --> [Consular Service]
    [Apostille Service] --> [Apostille Table]
    [Consular Service] --> [Consular Table]
}

@enduml
{% endplantuml %}

### 4.3. Why This Happened

In this case, the fact that the formats of the two documents were the same was just a coincidence. It could change at any time according to the user's requirements. The problem was that we reflected this coincidental situation in the implementation, ignoring the essence of the matter.

Programmers often tend to prioritize implementation convenience. It won't be easy to break that habit. However, you must strictly follow the domain concept.

## 5. Storing Encoded Filenames

A user tries to upload a `[file].txt` file using a web browser.

The filename that the user uploads contains special characters, so it needs to be URL encoded and sent to the server. Similarly, when the user wants to download the file, the filename needs to be URL encoded.

Then should the server store the encoded string (`%5Bfile%5D.txt`) as is in the DB? Or is it better to decode it back to `[file].txt` and store it?

If you store it as `[file].txt`, you have to encode it again when sending the file to the user. Then wouldn't it be more efficient to just store it as `%5Bfile%5D.txt` as received?

To understand the essence, we need to look at the user's thoughts.

The filename that the user uploaded is `[file].txt`. The user doesn't think it gets converted. Therefore, when storing it, it's right to store it as `[file].txt` according to the user's thoughts.

The reason for URL encoding in the first place is due to the technical limitation that only a part of the ASCII character set can be transmitted, not because of the user's requirements. It's not a good structure for the characteristics or limitations of a specific technology to affect other areas. Therefore, the technical problem that occurs in the HTML transmission process should be solved in that process, and bringing it to the DB becomes an anti-pattern where two large areas are tightly coupled.

Reflecting the user's intent more accurately takes priority over optimization.

If you only consider the download function, storing it as received would be the best choice. However, as the function expands to displaying the file list or allowing search, the original string (`[file].txt`) will be needed. This is because the user thinks of the filename as `[file].txt`. If you store it as `%5Bfile%5D.txt`, you will have difficulty implementing the view or search functions.

Pursuing implementation convenience like this makes you easily swayed by small changes.

## 6. Defining Functions Based on Essence

When developing a movie ticketing service, should we implement a shopping cart function? In e-commerce services, the shopping cart is an essential function, but is it also necessary for movie ticketing services?

To answer this question, we need to think about the user experience in the actual movie ticketing process. Generally, when a user books a movie, it proceeds in the following order:

1. Select movie
2. Select showtime
3. Select seats
4. Payment

In this process, we can't find an intermediate step like "add to cart". The user selects the movie, time, and seats, and proceeds directly to payment.

Then adding a shopping cart function to an online movie ticketing service may be a decision far from the user's actual experience. Rather, it may cause unnecessary complexity and undermine the consistency of online and offline experiences.

Of course, there may be user requirements like "It would be nice to have a function to save the selected movie for later payment". However, even in this case, rather than directly adopting the concept of a "shopping cart", it needs to be reinterpreted into a concept that fits the context of the movie ticketing service. For example, it may be more appropriate to provide it as a function of "saving interested movies" or "saving booking history".

## 7. Naming Based on Essence

I'm starting to develop a movie ticketing service as a project to convey basic knowledge about the backend. What should I name the project? Since it's about movie ticketing, how about ticket-service?

What we're trying to make is indeed a ticket-service. However, if we think about why we're making it, backend-fundamentals would be a better choice. ticket-service is just a means to convey basic knowledge about the backend. The means can always be changed.

In cases like this, `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` is needed even for choices that are not about code. In my case, I habitually ponder what the essence of the information I perceive is at every moment.

## 8. Conclusion

The common point shown by `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` in the examples we've looked at so far is that it focuses on 'why' rather than 'what'. 'What' is just one of the methods to reach 'why'. The purpose (why) doesn't change easily, but the method (what) can change at any time depending on various situations.

Another important reason to focus on 'why' is that all of the user's thoughts cannot be organized into documents at the analysis stage. This is the same for design. At the design stage, all of the designer's thoughts cannot be organized. This is because the code is what reflects the requirements and design to the maximum extent. There are bound to be some gaps, and those gaps are things that are thought to be known without explicitly mentioning them. The problem is that what the user considers obvious may be perceived very differently by the developer.

However, if you think with a focus on 'why', you end up looking at the same place, so even if there are some gaps in communication, the deviation won't be large. Reducing this potential difference in thoughts between users and developers is one of the important roles of `EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)`.

`EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` is such an obvious and fundamental concept that it's difficult to define its scope or specific practice methods. And it's not limited to development.

`EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation)` has a similar context to DDD(Domain-Driven Design) in that it should be based on the domain. However, DDD is a more systematic and concrete design methodology, and its main purpose is to respond to complex or frequently changing domains. On the other hand, EBI(Essence-Based Interpretation) is closer to a general way of thinking that can be applied to various fields, including software development, rather than a specific methodology.

The change in thinking that comes from contemplating good code has a greater value than you might think. The effort towards good code leads to the contemplation of strategies to respond to unpredictable changes by gaining insight into the essence. This is a precious challenge unique to software development that cannot be easily experienced in other fields.
