I am a programmer in my 40s interested in software architecture and development methodologies such as OOP/TDD/DDD/MSA.

Rather than acquiring a wide range of knowledge, I tend to ponder basic concepts for a long time.

Starting with Windows programming in 2001, I have worked on various projects, and these days, I often work with Node/NestJS, React/NextJS, and React Native.

I am looking for a tech leader position in interesting projects, regardless of scale.
